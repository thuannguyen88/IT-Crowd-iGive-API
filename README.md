# iGive API

## Project details:

For our School of Code final project, we created iGive, a community focused food giving app to help reduce food waste in the local community.

Front end hosted here: https://igive.netlify.app/

This repo contains the code deployed to back end via Heroku which holds the data for users and items of our app.
